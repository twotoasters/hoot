# Hoot-Android

A powerful, flexible, lightweight Android library for working with RESTful
web APIs.

## Building

You can build the library from the command-line using `ant`:

    # Package the application for distribution
    $ ant clean dist

    # Generate Javadoc for the project
    $ ant clean docs

> Note: In addition to building the project, the `dist` target will
> also invoke the `docs` target automatically.
